        We consider the problem of compressing an inflatable pneumatic structure. The origin of coordinates is taken at the ground surface, the y-axis
is directed upward, the x-axis is to the right. Determine the deformed shape of the two-tier pneumatic shell,
that is under pressure from the air cushion. The contact with the supporting surface is neglected.
